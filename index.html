        <h1>PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article><i><h3>We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit it and add a front end later so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘view in browser’ links in the student solutions - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!</h3></i></article>
